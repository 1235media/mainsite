            <h3>Hogwarts Legacy</h3>
            <img src="images/hogleg.png" />
            <p>
                The Hogwarts Legacy video game was largely done by WBGames Avalanche and Portkey games studios. However, a key part of its marketing was its ability to link gamers with a customer’s official profile from wizardingworld.com. This was wildly successful, far exceeding expectations of linking traffic. This was the best selling single player video game of 2023. The services our team provided worked very well and there are plans to use it for upcoming releases. Info on account linking can be found here.

                Leaning into the universe we built within Wizarding World, we built and launched an experience that married physical devices, like a magic wand and smart lightbulbs, with the digital engagement of an app. Pairing the pieces together, fans were able to wield a magic wand and interact with elements in their living room – casting spells to turn lights on and off, activate televisions, and enchant audio.
