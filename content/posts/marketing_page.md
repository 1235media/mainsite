<img style="float: left;" src="/images/postweb.png" alt="Simple image of a browser pane and all the sections that go into making a good web site">What goes into a marketing web site?  Something that’s little more than a poster on the web.  It’s easy.  Just put some web file things somewhere…and you’re all set!  Kind of, but there's more to it.  You need some really great designs (by a place like [StoryArc](https://www.storyarcinc.com/)).  


And not just designs that look great on _your_ wide screen monitor.  A big chunk of web traffic is mobile.  In the US it’s [about half](https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/united-states-of-america#monthly-202404-202504).  The design needs to look good on big monitors, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. GenX and the vanguard of the Millennials are getting older. A lot of us have wear readers when no one is looking. Those phones will have lots of differing font sizes & text enlargers.

You’ll need to spend a lot of time checking how things look across devices—otherwise your site might turn into a mess of broken CSS in certain form factors. It might look great on your iOS devices but about 50% of [US mobile web traffic](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america#monthly-202404-202504) comes from Android devices.  Chrome dominates desktop traffic but [25% of desktop web traffic](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america#monthly-202404-202504) comes from MS Edge and Apple’s Safari.

Are you collecting email addresses?  You'll want to send out email blasts to everyone who showed interest in your thing.  There are a number of email sign up services but you’ll need to get an account and style that form to look like your site.  Now you need a Privacy Policy and most likely a Terms & Conditions.  You can get that from a site like [termly.io](http://termly.io) but you’ll also probably want that to be styled like the rest of your site.  Any 3rd party cookies?  You need a cookie banner.  You'll need a 404 page.  All of these need to be themed with your main content.

Consider, we already have _four_ different pieces of external content for your site.  The forms they provide are fairly easy to implement but they all have limited options as far as changing the look and feel.  You want to know what those limitation are ahead of time and figure out what you can live with.  You don't want your user to feel like they are on a totally different website just because they clicked on the Privacy Policy or the Email signup form.

Are you selling tickets or accepting donations?  You’ll need a service for that!  That has to be configured so that you can accept funds and have a bank account for the funds to land in.

Once your site goes live you'll want to know how it's doing.  Sure you can plop Google Analytics on there to watch traffic but I'd recommending something like [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io).  They are GDPR compliant and they are cookie free!

And let’s go back to designs and the web page itself. Does it adhere to the accessibility guidelines? You’ll want to make sure you’re following best practices for:

1. Color contrast
2. Alt text for images
3. Keyboard navigation
4. ARIA roles as needed

Get all of that lined up and you’ll have a sharp looking site. It’s not rocket science, but there’s more to it than registering a domain name (oops! left that out, but you’ll want that and a TLS certificate to go with it).

Enjoy your day and if you need help with any of this, let us know: [info@1235media.com](info@1235media.com).
