What goes into a marketing web site?  Something that’s little more than a poster on the web.  It’s easy.  Just put some web file things somewhere…and you’re all set!  Kind of, but there's more to it.

You need some really great designs (by a place like [StoryArc](https://www.storyarcinc.com/)).  And not just designs that look great on your wide screen monitor.  A big chunk of web traffic these days is mobile.  In the US it’s [about half](https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/united-states-of-america#monthly-202404-202504).  So the design needs to look good on big monitors, laptops, tablets and mobile phones and those phones will have lots of differing font sizes & text enlargers.  

![alt text](/images/badcss.png "CSS Mug"){:style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}You’ll need to spend a lot of time checking how things look across devices—otherwise your site might turn into a mess of broken CSS in certain form factors. It might look great on your iOS devices but about 50% of [US mobile web traffic](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america#monthly-202404-202504) comes from Android devices.  Chrome dominates desktop traffic but 30% of desktop web traffic comes from MS Edge and Apple’s Safari.

Are you collecting email addresses?  You want to send out email blasts to everyone who showed interest in your thing.  Maybe to buy tickets or to let them know about other things you’re doing.  Now you need a Privacy Policy and most likely a Terms & Conditions.  You can get that from a site like [termly.io](http://termly.io) but you’ll also probably want that to be styled like the rest of your site.  Any 3rd party cookies?  You need a cookie banner.

Speaking of collecting email addresses, you’ll need somewhere to store those.  There are a number of email sign up services but you’ll need to get an account and style that form to look like your site.

Are you selling tickets or accepting donations?  You’ll need a service for that as well.  

And let’s go back to designs and the web page itself.  Does it adhere to the accessibility guidelines?  GenX and the vanguard of the Millennials are getting older.  A lot of us have readers.  You’ll want to make sure you’re following best practices for:
Color contrast
Alt text for images
Keyboard navigation
ARIA roles as needed

Get all of that lined up and you’ll have a sharp looking site.  It’s not rocket science, but there’s more to it than registering a domain name (oops! left that out, but you’ll want that and a TLS certificate to go with it).
